### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for stopping by. Here's a little bit about me: 
I am a principal developer with over 16 years of experience. I have extensive knowledge in game design, web development, and cloud architecture.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a small space-flight simulator in Unity. I am fascinated with space, so, it's been a ton of fun. Especially figuring out the physics involved.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a few different things, but have been mainly focused on Typescript, cloud architecture and IaC, and building 3D websites using @react-three/fiber.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything. If you require some help with your project and think I have a certain skill that might help, feel free to reach out! Or, if you're interested in collaborating on any of my public repo's you can jump in at any time!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Typescript, Golang, or Unity3d. That's bound to strike up a conversation.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: brandon@brandonmiller.io, or leave a comment on my blog: https://badassdev.io.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Performing multiplication in your code is always a fraction faster than division since, under the hood, the CPU breaks it down in to multiplication anyways. I.E. multiplying by 0.1 is faster than dividing by 100. Not a huge deal to most, but in cases where efficiency is everything, this can be a good trick to know!

Thanks for reading, and as always, feel free to
